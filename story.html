<p><font color=pink>Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self control I fear is never ending Controlling I can't seem To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced That there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting, reacting Against my will I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting how I can't seem To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced That there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing, confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming (confusing what is real) This lack of self control I fear is never ending Controlling (confusing what is real)
